## Proposed Use of Data
To select the best candidate businesses for a new food delivery service.  The service, unlike existing ones, will ship frozen meals or ingredients along with instructions to all markets within contiguous US.  To aid the selection process, we will review the user comments (tips) for certain restaurants from the Yelp dataset.

## Extract
Two sources of data is used
* Yelp dataset challenge.  Format: JSON
* IRS income by zipcode. Format: CSV
